# chess-tourney-stats
pulls data from USCF tournament history and plots results against opponents by rating.

This creates two graphs: one showing your results based on rating differential (up to 600 points in both directions)
and one that plots results based on your and your opponent's ratings. The latter is constrained to players/opponents rated between 1000
and 2600. I'll try to expand that soon, sorry. 

Data is based on regular-rated games only (not blitz, etc) and also doesn't include games with unrated players.
